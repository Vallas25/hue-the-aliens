# hue-the-aliens

the aliens are comming is a simple python script i created with phue (you probably have to install that first) where your lights go all flashy.

before you can use this programm you might have to install phue, althoug i'm not sure. But better safe than sorry

ofcourse you have to have philips hue lamps with a bridge. I'm 100% certain that it won't work without these lamps.

On line 6 you have to enter the ipadress of your bridge, you can find it easily in the app: go to settings; bridge; the i; on the forth line there can you find it; enter it in the programm, in the quotation marks.

you can change the names of the lamps you want to flicker in the quotation marks.

once you enterd the ip and the name of the lamps press on the round button in the middle, within 30 seconds the program has to run to find the bridge.

after the first run you can delete te 10th line, b.connect()
